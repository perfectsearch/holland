This package provides the holland_cvmysqlsv command to run
holland as a pre-script within a Commvault environment.

This provides a few features to support that environment:
        - HOME is set to /root
	- TMPDIR is set to /tmp
	- LD_LIBRARY_PATH is unset in order to use the
	  system libraries (avoiding certain libc
	  incompatibilities between mysql and commvault
	  that have been encountered in the past)

There is limited support for parsing commvault options,
but presently nothing is done with those parameters.
